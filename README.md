# stuck-fish
parody of stockfish, first attempt at a chess engine

includes options of playing against another player or vs the stuckfish computer

Will go partially on hold when comes time to replace the current initial low-intelligence engine

stuckfish bot in development:
  currently implemented piece value calculations
  added db to store games/positional evaluations
  added attacking identification module
  added starting point calculation for piece bonuses
  unexpected behavior in capture prospects
  still need to fix a/h pawn push
